Okay so this application of mine is running properly, I want to host it using github

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you host your application using GitHub. First, let me check if your project is already initialized with Git and if there's a GitHub repository connected.


---

```bash
git status | cat
```

```
muhammedabdurehman@Abdurs-MacBook-Air DocuDino % git status | cat
On branch main
Your branch is based on 'origin/main', but the upstream is gone.
  (use "git branch --unset-upstream" to fixup)

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .DS_Store
        .cursorindexingignore
        .gitignore
        backend/
        frontend/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

```

I see that Git is already initialized in your project, but there are some untracked files. Let's set up your project properly for GitHub hosting. Here's what we'll do:

1. First, let's create a proper `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files
2. Add and commit your files
3. Create a new repository on GitHub (you'll need to do this manually)
4. Connect and push your code to GitHub

Let me first check your current `.gitignore` file:


---

Read file: .gitignore

I'll create a more comprehensive `.gitignore` file for your project:
